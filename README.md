# Flask Market E-commerce

On this project we will code and deploy a "toy-webpage". The objective of this project was to get more familiar with Flask, HTML, CSS and SQLAlchemy to gain more clarity of the workflow when deploying ML models into production.

## Teachings

On this project I have deepen my knowledge in all the technologies mentioned. For example on HTML, starting from discovering new tags up until the concept of inheritence, and the idea of Boostrap on CSS. Then, I learned a lot of built-in classes from Flask such as FlaskForm to easily build a proper RegistrationForm class, different security techniques as hashing the passwords to store them on the Databases.
I hope you like and learn from the project as much as myself!
